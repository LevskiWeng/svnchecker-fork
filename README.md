# svnchecker-fork #
----

svnchecker-fork is a fork repository of [svnchecker](http://svnchecker.tigris.org/). 

As the [svnchecker project page](http://svnchecker.tigris.org/) says, svnchecker is already replaced by [RepoGuard](http://repoguard.tigris.org/). Although the RepoGuard is more powerful than svnchecker, it still lacks of detailed documentation right now. So I fork it here to fix some [svnchecker](http://svnchecker.tigris.org/)'s long-lasting bugs and do some enhancement till RepoGuard fulfills my need.

## Versioning

The version will obey the following rule:

`<svnchecker-version>.<fork-version>`

For example, the first version of this project will be 0.3.1 because the current svnchecker version is 0.3

## How to use

You could use this project according to the [manual of svnchecker](http://svnchecker.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList;jsessionid=AE41B5BC7EB23951DAD5B9B4A8B37625). And addtitional documentation is available in file [AdditionalManual.md](https://github.com/LevskiWeng/svnchecker-fork/blob/master/AdditionManual.md)
